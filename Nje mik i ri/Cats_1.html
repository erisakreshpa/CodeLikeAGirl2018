	<p><b>Cat's Type -Polydactyl.Age 1.(Confirmed by a vet.) </b><br /><br />
       Also known as "mitten cats" or "thumb cats," polydactyls have a genetic mutation that gives them more than the usual number of toes on one or more feet. 
       Polydactyl cats can have anywhere from six to eight toes per paw. The extra toes sometimes make them look like their paws have thumbs.
       While polydactyly can happen in many different animals, it’s arguably cutest in cats.</p>

	<p><b>Cat's Type -Norwegian Forest Cat.Age 1.(Confirmed by a vet.) </b><br /><br />
      If you like hugging a cat who’s a big armload of fur and can take what you dish out, then the Norwegian Forest Cat is for you.
	  A big cat with big paws and lots of fur, the Norwegian is like a Maine Coon cat’s Viking cousin. 
	  The large, muscular, affectionate, and calm Norwegian has a dense and water-resistant double coat and tufted toes and ears,
      making it the perfect companionfor snowshoeing, raiding neighboring countries, and standing atop the dragon head on the prow of a Viking ship.</p>
