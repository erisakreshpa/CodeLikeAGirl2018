	<p><b>Dog's Type -Labrador Retriever. Age 2.(Confirmed by a vet.) </b><br /><br />
	The best dog to have if you’re looking for a date, the only breed accepted for training as arson dogs, and one of the more popular breeds for service dogs.
	For a family, there’s hardly a better choice. Labradors love to please their humans, being playful, protective, loving, and reliable. 
	There’s nothing that a Lab loves more than to show off by learning a new trick, even if they manage to learn that new trick 
	before you’ve taught it to them.</p>

	<p><b>Dog's Type -Mutts. Age 3.(Confirmed by a vet.) </b><br /><br />
	In fact, consider a mixed breed in any case. Look for a dog that matches the energy level of your family, keeping one thing in mind — mid size
	 and larger dogs are great for families, while small breeds are not. If you have children, avoid Chihuahuas or Yorkies or anything you could 
	 pick up with one hand; look at terriers, retrievers, or other bigger dogs. In general, if you’re not afraid of injuring it by stepping on it, 
	 then it’s probably durable enough for children. </p>
